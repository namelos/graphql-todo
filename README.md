# GraphQL Todo Example

This is a minimalist GraphQL example to show how things work.

## Installation

```sh
npm i
```

## Run
```sh
npm start
```

Back-end locates in `server.mjs`.
Front-end locates in `src` directory.

Application runs at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
API playground runs at [http://localhost:4000/api](http://localhost:4000/api)

Have fun!
